The unified test-runner allows all (3) regression testsuites to be run with
a single command (run-tests). This can include the unit testsuite, the
expect testsuite and the python testsuite.

Quick Start:

* Configure, build, install and start Slurm
* cp BUILDDIR/testsuite/testsuite.conf.sample SRCDIR/testsuite/testsuite.conf
* cd SRCDIR/testsuite
* ./run-tests

To run the testsuites using the unified test-runner:

* Slurm must first be installed, configured and running.
* The testsuites requires the existence of a testsuite.conf file.
  Running configure will have created a sample configuration file in your
  build directory (BUILDDIR/testsuite/testsuite.conf.sample) which can be
  used as a starting point for this file. By default, the testsuite.conf file
  is expected to be found in the testsuite subdirectory of your source
  directory (SRCDIR/testsuite/testsuite.conf).
  If placed elsewhere, you must set the SLURM_TESTSUITE_CONF environment
  variable to the full path of your testsuite.conf file.
  Review and edit testsuite.conf as necessary.
* pytest (pytest-3) must be installed in order to run the python testsuite.
* expect must be installed in order to run the expect testsuite.
* If perldoc is installed, ./run-tests --man can be used to display a man page
  for the test-runner.
* Execute run-tests with the desired options to run the testsuites.

testsuite.conf:

The testsuite.conf configuration file contains parameters in the form:
"Parameter = Value" similar to parameter format in slurm.conf.
Supported parameters include:

SlurmSourceDir:  Slurm Source Directory (contains configure.ac and the src directory)
SlurmBuildDir:   Slurm Build Directory (where you ran configure and make from)
SlurmInstallDir: Slurm Installation Directory (value of --prefix configure option)
SlurmConfigDir:  Slurm Configuration Directory (compiled-in location of slurm.conf)

Tips:

* the include and exclude filters use (perl 5) regular expressions
* e.g. to run expect test1.1 use: run-tests -i expect/test1.1$
* to run just the unit tests, use: run-tests -i unit
* to run just the expect tests, use: run-tests -i expect
* to run just the python tests, use: run-tests -i python
